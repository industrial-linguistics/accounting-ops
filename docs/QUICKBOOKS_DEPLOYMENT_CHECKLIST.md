# QuickBooks Interface Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures all components are properly deployed and configured for the QuickBooks Online integration.

## Environment Selection

**Two broker environments are available:**

- **Production**: `auth.industrial-linguistics.com` - For live customer integrations with production OAuth credentials
- **Development**: `auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com` - For testing with sandbox OAuth credentials

See [DEV_BROKER_SETUP.md](DEV_BROKER_SETUP.md) for complete development environment setup.

**This checklist covers PRODUCTION deployment.** For development setup, follow the separate guide.

## Server Access & Environment

- [ ] **SSH Access Verified**
  ```bash
  ssh aops@merah.cassia.ifost.org.au
  ```
  - Confirm access credentials are available
  - Verify sudo/doas privileges if required

- [ ] **Server Platform Confirmed**
  - OS: OpenBSD (expected)
  - Web server: httpd with slowcgi
  - Verify server version: `uname -a`

## OAuth Broker Deployment

### CGI Binary

- [ ] **Broker Binary Installed**
  ```bash
  # Check broker binary exists and is executable
  ls -la /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/cgi-bin/broker
  file /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/cgi-bin/broker
  ```
  - Binary should be statically linked (CGO_ENABLED=0)
  - Verify ownership and permissions (typically www:www or _www:_www)
  - Check binary is not stripped if debugging needed

- [ ] **Deployment Script Available**
  - Script location: `scripts/build_deploy_openbsd.sh`
  - Review script for current deployment procedures
  - Verify script has correct SSH host and paths

### Configuration Files

- [ ] **Broker Configuration Present**
  ```bash
  # Check broker.env file
  ls -la /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/conf/broker.env
  cat /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/conf/broker.env
  ```
  - QuickBooks OAuth client ID configured
  - QuickBooks OAuth client secret configured (never commit to repo)
  - Database path configured for session storage
  - Verify environment variable names match broker code

- [ ] **QuickBooks OAuth Credentials Valid**
  - Client ID from Intuit Developer Portal
  - Client Secret from Intuit Developer Portal
  - Scopes: `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting` (minimum)
  - Redirect URI: `https://auth.industrial-linguistics.com/v1/callback/qbo`
  - Verify redirect URI is registered in Intuit Developer Portal

### Chroot Environment

- [ ] **Chroot DNS Configuration**
  ```bash
  # Verify DNS resolution works in chroot
  cat /var/www/etc/resolv.conf
  ```
  - Should contain valid nameservers
  - Test DNS from within chroot if possible

- [ ] **Chroot CA Certificates**
  ```bash
  # Verify SSL/TLS CA bundle
  ls -la /var/www/etc/ssl/cert.pem
  ```
  - Required for HTTPS requests to Intuit APIs
  - Should be up-to-date CA bundle

- [ ] **Session Database**
  ```bash
  # Check SQLite database for sessions
  ls -la /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/data/
  ```
  - Directory must be writable by www user
  - Database will be created on first use
  - Verify permissions allow broker to write

## Web Server Configuration

- [ ] **httpd Configuration**
  ```bash
  # Review httpd.conf for broker vhost
  cat /etc/httpd.conf | grep -A 20 "auth.industrial-linguistics.com"
  ```
  - Virtual host configured for auth.industrial-linguistics.com
  - CGI enabled with slowcgi
  - FastCGI socket path correct

- [ ] **slowcgi Running**
  ```bash
  # Check slowcgi service status
  rcctl check slowcgi
  ps aux | grep slowcgi
  ```
  - Service should be enabled and running
  - Verify socket location matches httpd config

- [ ] **httpd Service Status**
  ```bash
  rcctl check httpd
  ```
  - Service should be enabled and running
  - Check logs for errors: `tail -f /var/www/logs/error_log`

## TLS/SSL Configuration (Cloudflare)

- [ ] **Cloudflare TLS Certificate Valid**
  ```bash
  # Check certificate expiration (Cloudflare-issued)
  echo | openssl s_client -connect auth.industrial-linguistics.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
  ```
  - Certificate not expired
  - Issued for correct domain
  - Chain valid and trusted
  - Note: Certificate is managed by Cloudflare, not origin server

- [ ] **Cloudflare SSL/TLS Mode**
  - Verify SSL/TLS encryption mode in Cloudflare dashboard
  - Recommended: "Full" or "Full (strict)" mode
  - "Flexible" mode (Cloudflareâ†”origin uses HTTP) acceptable if origin is secured
  - Ensure mode matches origin server configuration (HTTP vs HTTPS)

- [ ] **Origin Server Configuration**
  ```bash
  # Check if origin serves HTTP or HTTPS
  # This is internal to the infrastructure
  ```
  - Origin may use HTTP (Cloudflare terminates TLS)
  - Or origin may use HTTPS (Full/Full strict mode)
  - No acme-client or Let's Encrypt needed on origin
  - httpd config should match Cloudflare SSL mode

- [ ] **HTTPS Redirect**
  - Cloudflare automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS
  - Test: `curl -I http://auth.industrial-linguistics.com`
  - Should see 301/302 redirect to HTTPS

## Broker Endpoints Testing

- [ ] **Health Check (if implemented)**
  ```bash
  curl https://auth.industrial-linguistics.com/health
  ```

- [ ] **OAuth Start Endpoint**
  ```bash
  # Test auth initiation (should return auth URL)
  curl -X POST https://auth.industrial-linguistics.com/v1/auth/start \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"provider":"qbo","profile":"test"}'
  ```
  - Returns session ID
  - Returns authorization URL
  - Returns poll URL

- [ ] **OAuth Callback Handling**
  - Callback endpoint: `/v1/callback/qbo`
  - Accepts authorization code from Intuit
  - Extracts `realmId` from query parameters
  - Stores session data correctly

- [ ] **Poll Endpoint**
  ```bash
  # Test polling (with valid session ID)
  curl https://auth.industrial-linguistics.com/v1/auth/poll/{session_id}
  ```
  - Returns pending status while waiting
  - Returns tokens + realmId once OAuth completes

- [ ] **Token Refresh Endpoint**
  ```bash
  # Test token refresh
  curl -X POST https://auth.industrial-linguistics.com/v1/token/refresh \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"provider":"qbo","refresh_token":"<token>"}'
  ```
  - Accepts refresh token
  - Returns new access token + refresh token
  - New tokens rotated (old refresh token invalidated)

## Client Tools Deployment

  - Polls broker for completion
  - Stores tokens in OS keychain
  - Stores realmId with credentials

- [ ] **CLI Token Refresh**
  ```bash
  acct refresh --profile "Test Company"
  ```
  - Fetches refresh token from keychain
  - Calls broker refresh endpoint
  - Updates keychain with new tokens

### C++ Qt Tools

  # Should return session ID, auth URL, and poll URL
  ```

### QuickBooks Sandbox Configuration

- [ ] **Redirect URI Registered**
  - Log into https://developer.intuit.com/
  - Go to "My Apps" â†’ Your App â†’ "Keys & credentials"
  - Under **Development** section, verify redirect URI:
    ```
    https://auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/v1/callback/qbo
    ```

- [ ] **Sandbox Companies Available**
  - Click "Test connect to app (OAuth)" in developer portal
  - Should see list of sandbox companies
  - Create test companies if needed

### CLI Testing with Development Broker

- [ ] **Environment Variable Set**
  ```bash
  export ACCOUNTING_OPS_BROKER=https://auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/cgi-bin/broker
  acct connect qbo --profile "Test Sandbox Company"
  ```

- [ ] **OAuth Flow Completes**
  - Browser opens to QuickBooks sandbox login
  - Lists sandbox companies only (not real companies)
  - Select a sandbox company
  - CLI receives tokens successfully
  - Profile saved to OS keychain

- [ ] **Verify Stored Credentials**
  ```bash
  acct list
  # Should show "Test Sandbox Company (qbo)"

  acct whoami --profile "Test Sandbox Company" --provider qbo
  # Should show realm ID and expiration
  ```

### GitHub Actions Deployment

- [ ] **Workflow Configured for Dev**
  - Check `.github/workflows/deploy-broker.yml`
  - Should trigger on `develop` and `feature/**` branches
  - Should deploy to `auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com`

- [ ] **Test Dev Deployment**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/test-dev-deploy
  # Make a trivial change to cmd/broker/
  git commit -m "Test dev deployment"
  git push origin feature/test-dev-deploy
  ```
  - Check GitHub Actions run
  - Verify deployment to development broker
  - Verify production broker unchanged

### Comparison: Production vs Development

| Aspect | Production | Development |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Domain** | auth.industrial-linguistics.com | auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com |
| **Git Branch** | main | develop, feature/* |
| **QBO Environment** | production | sandbox |
| **QBO Credentials** | Production keys | Sandbox/development keys |
| **Companies** | Real customer data | Test/sandbox companies |
| **Auto-deploy** | Push to `main` | Push to non-main branches |
| **CLI Access** | Default | Set `ACCOUNTING_OPS_BROKER` env var |

### Verify Isolation

- [ ] **Separate Configuration Files**
  ```bash
  doas diff /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/conf/broker.env \
            /var/www/vhosts/auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/conf/broker.env
  # Should show different CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and ENVIRONMENT values
  ```

- [ ] **Separate Session Storage**
  ```bash
  ls -l /var/www/vhosts/auth.industrial-linguistics.com/data/
  ls -l /var/www/vhosts/auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/data/
  # Should have separate session.db files
  ```

- [ ] **CLI Profiles Separate**
  ```bash
  # Production profile
  acct connect qbo --profile "Real Company"

  # Development profile (different broker, different name)
  export ACCOUNTING_OPS_BROKER=https://auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/cgi-bin/broker
  acct connect qbo --profile "Sandbox Company"

  # List both
  acct list
  # Should show both profiles with distinct names
  ```

### Troubleshooting Development Environment

**Issue: dev broker returns 404**
```bash
# Check httpd config includes dev virtual host
doas cat /etc/httpd.conf | grep auth-dev
# Check broker binary exists
ls -lh /var/www/vhosts/auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/cgi-bin/broker
# Check httpd and slowcgi are running
rcctl check httpd slowcgi
```

**Issue: OAuth returns redirect_uri_mismatch**
```bash
# Verify redirect URI in Intuit developer portal
# Must exactly match: https://auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/v1/callback/qbo
# Check for trailing slashes, http vs https
```

**Issue: Connecting to production companies instead of sandbox**
```bash
# Verify broker.env has QBO_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
doas grep QBO_ENVIRONMENT /var/www/vhosts/auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/conf/broker.env
# Verify using sandbox credentials (from Development section in Intuit portal)
doas grep QBO_CLIENT_ID /var/www/vhosts/auth-dev.industrial-linguistics.com/conf/broker.env
```
