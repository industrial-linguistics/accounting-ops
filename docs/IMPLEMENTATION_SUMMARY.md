# Implementation Summary

## Overview
The repository now delivers a cross-platform suite of C++/Qt desktop tools
alongside reusable libraries for managing accounting integration skills.

## Key Deliverables

### Modular Build Layout
* **skills_core** static library with credential management and skill
  repository utilities supporting multiple client accounts per service.
* **tooling_common** shared Qt widgets for selecting clients and triggering
  connection diagnostics.

### GUI Tools (individual executables)
* `deputy_tool` – validates Deputy credentials for any configured client.
* `xero_tool` – confirms Xero OAuth token readiness via an interactive check.
* `quickbooks_tool` – verifies QuickBooks credentials prior to synchronisation.
* `client_manager_tool` – browses and audits the multi-client credential store.
* `skill_editor_tool` – loads, edits, and saves JSON-based skill definitions.

Each executable has its own CMake target enabling independent packaging and
store submission for Linux, Haiku, macOS, and Windows.

### Credential Model Enhancements
* JSON credential store (`config/credentials.json`) supporting multiple clients
  with distinct Deputy, Xero, and QuickBooks entries.
* GUI tools automatically surface missing credentials and provide diagnostic
  messaging for non-technical operators.

### Skill Management
* Canonical skill definitions shipped under `skills/data/*.skill.json`.
* Qt-based editor for reviewing and updating skill files in any project.

### Documentation & Packaging
* Detailed build and packaging guide (`docs/BUILDING.md`).
* Unix man pages for every tool (`docs/man/man1/*.1`).
* End-user help files included in packages (`docs/help/*.md`).
* CPack configuration generates installable archives suitable for redistribution
  or app store ingestion after code signing where required.
