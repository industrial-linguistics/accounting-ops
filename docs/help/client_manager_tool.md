# Client Manager Tool

This tool lists every client stored in the credential inventory and displays
key metadata for each connected service.

## Quick start
1. Run `first_run_gui_tool` or `first_run_cli_tool` if the credential database
   (`config/credentials.sqlite`) has not been created yet.
2. Launch the application; it automatically loads the shared credential
   database when present.
3. Click a client on the left-hand list to view their service details.
4. Use the **Refresh** toolbar action after making changes with the
   first-run tools.

## Editing credentials
Use the first-run assistants to add or update client records. The Client Manager
provides a read-only view so that operators can review entries without editing
sensitive values directly.
