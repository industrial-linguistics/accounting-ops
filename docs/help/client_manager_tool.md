# Client Manager Tool

This tool lists every client stored in the credential inventory and displays
key metadata for each connected service.

## Quick start
1. Launch the application; it automatically loads `credentials.json` when
   present.
2. Click a client on the left-hand list to view their service details.
3. Use the **Refresh** toolbar action after editing the credential file on
disk.

## Editing credentials
For security, edits are performed with an external editor. After updating
the JSON file, return to the Client Manager and refresh to see the changes.
