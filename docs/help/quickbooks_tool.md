# QuickBooks Connection Tool

Validate that QuickBooks Online credentials are configured for each client.

## Usage
1. Start the tool and ensure the credential file is accessible.
2. Provide the client name that maps to QuickBooks.
3. Click **Test Connection**. A success dialog confirms simulated endpoint
   checks.

## Notes
The tool surfaces missing or mislabelled credentials to help non-technical
users correct setup issues before automation runs.
