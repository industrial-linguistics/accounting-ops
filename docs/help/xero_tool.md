# Xero Connection Tool

Use the Xero tool to verify that OAuth credentials are in place for each
client before initiating payroll or invoicing operations.

## Quick start
1. Launch the tool and confirm the credential file location.
2. Enter the client name associated with a Xero organisation.
3. Click **Test Connection** to run simulated token checks.
4. Review the on-screen results.

## Troubleshooting
If the tool reports missing credentials, open the Client Manager to confirm
that the Xero entry exists and contains the correct client ID and refresh
token values.
