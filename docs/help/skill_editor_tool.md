# Skill Editor Tool

The skill editor provides a lightweight interface for reviewing and updating
JSON skill files.

## Opening skills
* Use **Open skill directory** to select the project folder that holds `.skill.json` files.
* The left pane lists each skill by name.

## Editing
* Select a skill to display its JSON in the editor.
* Click **Save** to write changes back to disk.
* Use **Reload** to refresh from disk when collaborating with others.

## Tip
Skills are shipped under `skills/data`. Copy these files to a project-specific
location if you want to make local customisations.
